# Parkinsons-detection-using-regression-
This project predicts the parkinsons with model selction or features selections like 1. Linear Regression 2. DecisionTreeRegressor 3. SVR 4.KNeighborsRegressor. Also this data is in continuous , therefore only regression is used and to calculate the accuracy method of rmse is used.Also, this project consist these things :1) Preparing data (Feature Identification)  2)Choosing a model (Comparative study min. 3 model) 4)Training (Reiterating for optimization) 5)Hyperparameter tuning
