# Parkinsons-detection-using-regression-
This project predicts the parkinsons with model selction or features selections like 
1. Linear Regression 
2. DecisionTreeRegressor 
3. SVR 
4.KNeighborsRegressor. 
The data was continuous , therefore only regression is used and to calculate the accuracy method of rmse is used.
Also, this project consist these things :
1) Preparing data (Feature Identification)  
2)Choosing a model (Comparative study min. 3 model) 
3)Checking Null Values
4)Training (Reiterating for optimization) 
5)Hyperparameter tuning
